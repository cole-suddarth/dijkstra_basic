This program uses a simplistic version of the Dijkstra Algorithim in order to take a maze and solve the maze from a point such that each node or '#' in the maze file is replaced with a number representing the distance to that node from the starting point

The program asks a user for a file to open, in a similar format to the maze_01.txt file in this repository. It reads the file and converts these to a Dijkstra Node which is a class which has attricutes dist and if done. It has multiple methods to adjust the distance and if done attribute, which can be found in the dijkstra_node.py file.

This porgram is performed using the Python language, and is closed and not looking for adjustment.
